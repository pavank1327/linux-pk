In Linux, you can copy multiple files using the cp command. Here are some common ways to do it:

1. Copy Multiple Files to a Directory

--> cp file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt /destination/directory/

This copies file1.txt, file2.txt, and file3.txt to /destination/directory/.

2. Copy All Files with a Specific Pattern

--> cp *.txt /destination/directory/

This copies all .txt files to /destination/directory/.

3. Copy Multiple Files Using Brace Expansion

--> cp {file1.txt,file2.txt,file3.txt} /destination/directory/

This is another way to copy specific files.

4. Copy Files from Multiple Directories

--> cp /source1/file1.txt /source2/file2.txt /destination/

This copies file1.txt from /source1/ and file2.txt from /source2/ into /destination/.

5. Copy an Entire Directory (-r for Recursive)

--> cp -r /source/directory/ /destination/

This copies everything inside /source/directory/ to /destination/.
